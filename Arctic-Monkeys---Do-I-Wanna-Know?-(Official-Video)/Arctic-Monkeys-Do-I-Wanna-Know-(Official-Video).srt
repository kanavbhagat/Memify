00:00:29,908 --> 00:00:34,807
Have you got color in your cheks?

2
00:00:35,017 --> 00:00:38,416
Do you ever get that feelin′ that
you can′t shift the tide

3
00:00:38,606 --> 00:00:42,405
That sticks around like summat′s
in your teeth

4
00:00:42,605 --> 00:00:46,104
Ah‚ there′s some aces up your sleeve

5
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:49,199
Have you no idea that You are in deep

6
00:00:49,417 --> 00:00:53,716
I dreamt about you nearly
every night this week

7
00:00:53,914 --> 00:00:57,713
How many secrets can you keep?

8
00:00:57,915 --> 00:01:02,214
′Cause there′s this tune I found that
makes me think of you somehow

9
00:01:02,412 --> 00:01:05,911
When I play it on repeat

10
00:01:06,117 --> 00:01:09,216
Until I fall asleep

11
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:13,209
Spilling drinks on my settee

12
00:01:13,411 --> 00:01:15,710
(Do I wanna know?)

13
00:01:15,904 --> 00:01:19,003
If this feeling flows both ways

14
00:01:19,211 --> 00:01:21,510
(Sad to see you go)

15
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:24,309
Was sorta hoping that You had stay

16
00:01:24,515 --> 00:01:27,014
(Baby we both know)

17
00:01:27,206 --> 00:01:30,705
That the nights were mainly
made for saying

18
00:01:30,903 --> 00:01:35,002
Things that you can′t say tomorrow day

19
00:01:35,212 --> 00:01:37,811
Crawlin′ back to you

20
00:01:38,007 --> 00:01:43,906
Ever thought of calling when
You have had a few?

21
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:47,103
′Cause I always do

22
00:01:47,299 --> 00:01:55,098
Maybe I am too busy being yours
to fall for somebody new

23
00:01:55,306 --> 00:01:57,705
Now I have thought it through

24
00:01:57,919 --> 00:02:00,718
Crawling back to you

25
00:02:00,916 --> 00:02:05,315
So have you got the guts?

26
00:02:05,511 --> 00:02:08,410
Been wondering if your heart′s
still open and

27
00:02:08,616 --> 00:02:13,415
If so I wanna know what time it shuts

28
00:02:13,601 --> 00:02:16,300
Simmer down and pucker up

29
00:02:16,502 --> 00:02:20,401
I am sorry to interrupt It
is just I am constantly

30
00:02:20,615 --> 00:02:26,614
On the cusp of trying to kiss you

31
00:02:26,812 --> 00:02:34,811
I don′t know if you feel
the same as I do

32
00:02:35,005 --> 00:02:43,004
But we could be together‚
if you wanted to

33
00:02:43,604 --> 00:02:46,403
(Do I wanna know?)

34
00:02:46,601 --> 00:02:49,200
If this feeling flows both ways

35
00:02:49,414 --> 00:02:52,013

36
00:02:52,203 --> 00:02:54,602

37
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,299

39
00:03:01,116 --> 00:03:05,315
Things that you can′t say tomorrow day

40
00:03:05,515 --> 00:03:07,314
Crawling back to you

41
00:03:07,506 --> 00:03:09,005
Crawling back to you

42
00:03:09,207 --> 00:03:15,906
Ever thought of calling when
You have had a few? (calling
when You have had a few)

43
00:03:16,116 --> 00:03:17,215
′Cause I always do (′cause
I always do)

44
00:03:17,411 --> 00:03:25,410
Maybe I am too busy being yours
to fall for somebody new

45
00:03:25,816 --> 00:03:28,015
Now I have thought it through

46
00:03:28,201 --> 00:03:31,100
Crawling back to you‚
(do I wanna know?)

47
00:03:31,308 --> 00:03:34,207
If this feeling flows both ways

48
00:03:34,411 --> 00:03:37,110
(Sad to see you go)

49
00:03:37,304 --> 00:03:39,803
Was sorta hoping that You had stay

50
00:03:40,017 --> 00:03:42,516
(Baby we both know)

51

That the nights were mainly
made for saying

52
00:03:46,313 --> 00:03:51,312
Things that you can′t say tomorrow day

53
00:03:51,514 --> 00:03:53,713
(Do I wanna know?)

54
00:03:53,901 --> 00:03:56,800
Too busy being yours to fall

55
00:03:57,008 --> 00:03:59,507
(Sad to see you go)

56
00:03:59,707 --> 00:04:03,306
Ever thought of calling darling?

57
00:04:03,508 --> 00:04:05,107
(Do I wanna know)

58
00:04:05,307 --> 00:04:10,306
Do you want me crawling back to you?

59
00:04:11,308 --> 00:04:20,307
